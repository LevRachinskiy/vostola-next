# Vostola Next.js App

This project the xisting static site in a modern **Next.js** setup so that you can start iterating fast.

## Quick Start

```bash
unzip vostola_next.zip
cd vostola-next
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open in <http://localhost:3000> with your browser.

## What Happened?

* Your original static files now live in **/public** — Next serves them directly.
* The homepage (`pages/index.js`) renders your existing `index.html` inside an `<iframe>` so everything looks exactly the same out‑of‑the‑box.
* Start replacing pieces of the iframe with real React components whenever you‘re ready.

Happy building!
